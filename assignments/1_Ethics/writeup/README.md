This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)
	Telling the public or anyone who is not directly involved in the development of the car is dangerous. The reason for this is that if word gets out to the public, hackers will see an opportunity -- one that would not have been noticed if you had not told everyone. On the other hand, the public will see the flaw as one less option for buying a car. People are afraid and will avoid cars with vulnerablilities. For these reasons alone, it is safer to keep it a secret even until the problem is fixed. However, if the car is released and the problem still exists, the public needs to know. The first person to tell within your company is your boss. Aside from that fact that it is your job to say any problems, the boss is the first person that can issue orders for a team and get the problem fixed.
	Of course, there is always the perspective of the public. The public would want to know if a car has problems before they buy it. However, if the problem is fixed before the car is released, then there is no need to worry because the problems are gone and so, there was no need to know in the first place. Unfortunately, in reality this is not always the case. For example, what if the team is unable to eliminate all security threats? What if the company is unwilling to postpone the ECU's release? Considering that people could be killed due to this,I would first explain that I will tell the public if the car is released without fixing the security problems. My reasoning for this is that if the flaw is discovered by hackers, people could get killed because of it. Additionally, the company would suffer huge losses from people suing. 
	If the company is unwilling to postpone the release, there is still another solution. If the security problems are only software based, then the team can continue to fix the problem while the car is released. This is possible through software updates to the car. However, the car is vulnerable and there is a chancethe problems may be discovered before it is fixed. This is why the public should know if the car is released. It is also important to see the perspective of the company. The company needs to make money and does not have a lot of time so they must leave any problems as is. This is dangerous and potentially law-breaking. If I do nothing, I am responsible for the harm that may result. By knowingly allowing a hazard out on the streets, I should be responsible for anything that happens. However, if I told the boss and the public because the boss did not do anything, it is not my fault then.
